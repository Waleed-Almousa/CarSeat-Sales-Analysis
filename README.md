# CarSeat-Sales-Analysis
R Studio coding project analyzing how different variables impact car seat sales, and using these variables to construct a linear model


The data set used for this project is the ‘Carseats’ data set from the ‘ISLR’ package. The goal of this project is to determine which variables are most impactful on the number of Car Seat sales, and then use these variables to create a linear regression model to predict car seat sales. 

The HTML Document is comprised of the following sections:

1. Data Visualization: Created simple graphs and linear regression model to visualize the data

2. Creating the model: Implemented stepwise variable selection method to develop and optimize a linear regression model of CarSeat sales

3. Interpreting the model: Provided an explanation of selected variables and what the coefficients of each respective variable represents

4. Evaluating the model: Performed Cross validation to find the out of sample MSE of the model

5. Discussion: Explained Potential model violations and how this model can be useful




Project was completed independantly during fall 2023 semester.
